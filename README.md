# LinkedIn Queens Clone ðŸ‘‘
## Overview
One of my favorite parts about LinkedIn is the daily in-stream puzzle games that were added back in May 2024. I wake up every morning and keep my streak up 
before I do anything else and my favorite of all of these games is Queens. In Queens, you have to place queens into different areas of a square with the following rules.

- There should be one queen in each colored area inside a square.
- There cannot be two queens in the same row or column.
- The queens may not touch each other diagonally.

The square can contain an arbitrary number of colored areas so there can be any number of queens per puzzle. The puzzle is never the same and the shapes of each area is always different from one puzzle to the next.\

### Why I made this
One day as I was playing, I wondered how LinkedIn managed to generate different puzzles everyday. My thought was it may be a complex algorithm that proceduarally generates each puzzle day after day. I asked some
 employees at LinkedIn but they never got back to me so I decided to try to prove that that was how they were doing it by making my own implementation.
